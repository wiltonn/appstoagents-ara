## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Impact Risks (+25-40% time increase)

**OpenAI API Integration**
- Risk: Streaming implementation complexity, rate limits
- Mitigation: Early POC, fallback to cached responses

**Clerk Authentication Edge Cases**
- Risk: Guest-to-user migration failures, session handling
- Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, robust error handling

**Vercel Edge Runtime Limitations**
- Risk: Memory/performance constraints, cold starts
- Mitigation: Function optimization, caching strategies

### Medium-Impact Risks (+15-25% time increase)

**pgvector Database Setup**
- Risk: Specialized knowledge requirements, performance tuning
- Mitigation: Database specialist consultation

**WebSocket Connection Management**
- Risk: Connection reliability, scaling issues
- Mitigation: Connection pooling, fallback mechanisms

**PDF Generation Scaling**
- Risk: Puppeteer resource management, queue bottlenecks
- Mitigation: Queue monitoring, worker auto-scaling

### Low-Impact Risks (+5-15% time increase)

**Third-party Service Dependencies**
- Risk: API changes, service outages
- Mitigation: Version pinning, service monitoring

**Performance Requirements**
- Risk: p95 latency targets not met
- Mitigation: Performance budgets, continuous monitoring

- Simple authentication (logged-in users only)
- Basic scoring engine
- Manual PDF generation

**Success Criteria**
- Complete audit flow works end-to-end
- Basic performance targets met
- Security fundamentals implemented

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (4-6 weeks)
**Advanced Features**
- Guest user support with migration
- Real-time chat integration
- Auto-save and state persistence
- Automated PDF generation with queue

**Success Criteria**

- Chat context and autofill working
- PDF generation scaling to target throughput

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (2-3 weeks)
**Optimization & Hardening**
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing
- Security hardening
- Monitoring and observability

**Success Criteria**

## Cost Estimation (Rough Order of Magnitude)

### Development Team Costs
**Senior Full-Stack Developer** ($100-150/hour)
- Total: $39,500 - $68,250

**Mid-Level Developer Team** ($75-100/hour)  
- Total: $29,625 - $45,500

### Infrastructure & Services (Monthly)
- Vercel Pro: $20/month
- Clerk Pro: $25/month  
- OpenAI API: $50-200/month (usage-based)
- Database hosting: $50-100/month
- Monitoring/observability: $30-50/month

## Key Assumptions

1. **Team Experience**: Moderate familiarity with chosen tech stack
2. **Requirements Stability**: No major scope changes during development
3. **Third-party Services**: APIs remain stable and performant
4. **Testing Strategy**: Automated testing implemented progressively
5. **DevOps Complexity**: Standard CI/CD pipeline requirements

---

## Recommendation

**Recommended Approach**: 3-phase development with 2-3 developer team

**Total Investment**: 6-10 weeks, $30,000-$70,000 development cost

**Critical Success Factors**:
- Early integration testing of Clerk + OpenAI
- Performance monitoring from day one  
- Incremental delivery with user feedback
- 20% time buffer for integration complexity
