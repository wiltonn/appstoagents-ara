## 🏗️ Infrastructure Overview

The Agent Readiness Audit (ARA) system uses modern cloud infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability across multiple environments.

### Architecture Philosophy
- **Cloud-Native**: Designed for serverless and edge computing
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Everything managed through Terraform
- **Multi-Environment**: Consistent deployments across dev/staging/prod
- **Observability-First**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Security by Design**: Multiple layers of security controls

- **Database**: PlanetScale (MySQL with vector capabilities)
- **Cache**: Upstash Redis (Multi-zone in production)
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 (Object storage for PDFs)
- **CDN**: Cloudflare (Global content delivery)
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics + OpenTelemetry

### Infrastructure Management

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### Environment Strategy
```
Development → Staging → Production
    ↓           ↓          ↓
  - Testing   - Pre-prod  - Live users
  - Features  - Validation - High availability
  - Debugging - Load test  - Full monitoring
```

### Deployment Pipeline
1. **Infrastructure Deployment**: Terraform provisions resources
2. **Application Deployment**: Code deployed to Vercel
3. **Health Validation**: Automated health checks
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Alerts and dashboards configured
5. **Rollback Ready**: Automated rollback on failure

## 🗃️ Cache Infrastructure

### Upstash Redis Configuration

#### Production
```yaml
Database: ara-system-prod
Region: us-east-1
TLS: Enabled
Consistent: true
Multi-zone: true
Backup Region: us-west-1
```

#### Development/Staging
```yaml
Database: ara-system-{env}
Region: us-east-1
TLS: Enabled
Consistent: false
Multi-zone: false
```

### Cache Usage Patterns
- **Session Storage**: User wizard progress and guest sessions
- **API Response Caching**: Frequently accessed data
- **Rate Limiting**: API throttling and abuse prevention
- **Real-time Data**: WebSocket connection management

## 📦 Storage Infrastructure

### Cloudflare R2 Configuration
```yaml
Bucket: ara-reports-{environment}
Region: ENAM (Eastern North America)
Lifecycle: 
  - Production: 365 days retention
  - Development: 30 days retention
CORS: Enabled for direct uploads
Versioning: Enabled for production
```

### Storage Features
- **Signed URLs**: Secure access through Cloudflare Worker

- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent tiering and compression

### Cloudflare Worker (Signed URL Service)
```javascript
// R2 Operations
- POST /r2/upload   - Generate presigned upload URL
- GET /r2/download  - Generate presigned download URL  
- DELETE /r2/delete - Delete objects securely
```
