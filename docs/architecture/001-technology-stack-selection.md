# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The ARA System requires a modern, scalable technology stack that can handle:
- Complex multi-step wizard interfaces
- Real-time AI chat integration
- Sophisticated scoring algorithms
- PDF report generation
- Both guest and authenticated user flows
- High performance with excellent SEO

We needed to select a technology stack that would provide:
- Type safety across the entire application
- Excellent developer experience
- Strong performance characteristics
- Scalability for future growth
- Cost-effective deployment options

## Decision
We have selected the following technology stack:

**Frontend Framework**: Astro v4 with React 18 islands architecture
**Backend Framework**: tRPC v11 with Vercel Edge Runtime  
**Database**: PostgreSQL 15 + pgvector + Prisma ORM  
**Authentication**: Clerk with dual guest/authenticated flow  
**AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with streaming  
**Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for PDF reports  
**Caching**: Upstash Redis for performance optimization  
**Styling**: TailwindCSS + DaisyUI  
**Deployment**: Vercel Edge with serverless functions

## Rationale

### Astro v4 + React Islands
- **Performance**: Astro's islands architecture provides excellent performance by shipping minimal JavaScript
- **SEO**: Server-side rendering with static generation capabilities
- **Developer Experience**: React islands for interactive components while maintaining static performance
- **Flexibility**: Can integrate other frameworks if needed in the future

### tRPC v11
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety from database to frontend
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript integration with auto-completion
- **Performance**: Efficient serialization and minimal network overhead
- **Real-time**: Built-in support for subscriptions and streaming

### PostgreSQL + pgvector + Prisma
- **Reliability**: PostgreSQL is battle-tested for enterprise applications
- **Vector Support**: pgvector enables semantic search for chat messages
- **Type Safety**: Prisma provides type-safe database access
- **Migration Support**: Robust schema migration capabilities

### Clerk Authentication
- **Ease of Integration**: Drop-in authentication solution
- **Guest Flow Support**: Excellent support for anonymous users
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security features
- **User Management**: Comprehensive user management dashboard

### OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimized model for our use case with lower costs
- **Performance**: Fast response times suitable for real-time chat
- **Streaming**: Native support for streaming responses
- **Reliability**: Proven API with excellent uptime

### Vercel Edge Deployment
- **Performance**: Global edge network for low latency
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on demand
- **Developer Experience**: Seamless integration with our stack
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Pay-per-use pricing model

## Alternatives Considered

### Frontend Alternatives
1. **Next.js 14**: Excellent React framework but more complex than needed for our use case
2. **SvelteKit**: Great performance but smaller ecosystem and team familiarity
3. **Remix**: Good SSR capabilities but less mature ecosystem
4. **Pure React SPA**: Would sacrifice SEO and initial load performance

### Backend Alternatives
1. **Express.js + REST**: More traditional but lacks type safety and would require more boilerplate
2. **GraphQL + Apollo**: Powerful but adds complexity and would require additional tooling
3. **Fastify**: High performance but would need more custom middleware
4. **NestJS**: Enterprise features but overkill for our application size

### Database Alternatives
1. **MongoDB**: Document database would work but lacks ACID guarantees and pgvector functionality
2. **Supabase**: Good PostgreSQL hosting but we prefer direct database control
3. **PlanetScale**: Excellent MySQL hosting but would lose pgvector capabilities
4. **Firebase**: Easy to use but vendor lock-in and limited query capabilities

### Authentication Alternatives
1. **NextAuth.js**: Good integration but would require more custom implementation for guest flows
2. **Auth0**: Enterprise features but higher cost and complexity
3. **Firebase Auth**: Easy integration but vendor lock-in
4. **Custom JWT**: Full control but significant security and maintenance overhead

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Type Safety**: Full-stack type safety reduces bugs and improves developer productivity
- **Performance**: Excellent performance characteristics for both SSR and client-side interactions
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling with excellent debugging and development capabilities
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports scaling from MVP to enterprise-level usage
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-use pricing models keep costs low during early stages
- **Maintenance**: Well-maintained open-source packages with active communities

### Negative Consequences
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Astro and tRPC if not familiar
- **Vendor Dependencies**: Reliance on Vercel, Clerk, and OpenAI for critical functionality
- **Edge Runtime Limitations**: Some Node.js packages may not work in edge environment
- **Complexity**: Modern stack requires understanding of multiple technologies

### Risk Mitigation
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Most components can be replaced (e.g., Clerk → NextAuth, Vercel → other hosts)
- **Edge Limitations**: Careful package selection and testing for edge compatibility
- **Learning Curve**: Comprehensive documentation and gradual team onboarding
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates and dependency monitoring
