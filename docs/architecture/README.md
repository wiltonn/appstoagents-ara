# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the ARA System. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the development process, including the context, alternatives considered, and rationale for each decision.

## Contributing

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Create a new ADR using the template above
2. Include the ADR number in sequential order
3. Add the ADR to the index table above
4. Get review and approval from the team
5. Update the status once the decision is finalized
